    "Note the unit “spikes/s”. Alternatively, you may use “counts/s”, “impulses/s” (ips) or just “1/s”. In Neuroscience (also in Computational Neuroscience), it is unfortunately very common to use “Hz” as a unit of the firing rate. Although it is mathematically correct (Hz = 1/s), this doesn’t make much sense and is often misleading: First, the unit “Hz” honours the work of the physicists Heinrich Hertz on electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are periodic signals. Spike trains, in contrast, are typically highly irregular (non-periodic) signals. The unit “Hz” should be used as a unit of frequency for periodic signals only. Second, in Neuroscience often both (irregular) spike trains and periodic signals (e.g. Fourier components of local-field potentials, EEG, etc.) are considered at the same time. Using different units for the spike frequency and the oscillation frequency leads to a much more transparent presentation of research results. </span>"
